# The behat way 




<!--v-->
To test the use cases we use behat and the gherkin syntax. 
<br><br>
This syntax allows you to describe your feature with concrete examples. 
These examples must be made in a functional way, we avoid implementation details. 
<br><br>
To ensure that the scenario is good, the scenario must work in any context (web app, API, console app)
